# Mind Matters Louisville
The current concept is that this will be a weekly reading group. Topics will be loosely centered around Aritificial Intelligence, Cognitive Science, Pattern Recognition, and similar areas. Each week two people will distribute a short excerpt, paper, or similar through this repository and then will lead a discussion when the group meets. It will be a priority that these discussion should not require more than a casual familiarity with related concepts and thus should be accessible to a somewhat general audience.

That's all right now. Of course, there are a ton of possibilities but we want to keep it focused before we consider broadening the group.

This group will always be public (otherwise someone would have to pay for it!) so no official membership is necessary. If you are interested in contributing directly from the org, email nicholas.searcy@gmail.com (currently maintaining the org) with your github handle and you will be added.
