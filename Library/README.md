Library
=======
Storage for relevant articles, excerpts, and so on.

- For now, try to organize files in folders according to primary topic and name files as "primary_author-year-title.pdf"
- An example might be "/AI_Completeness/Turing-1950-Computing_Machinery_and_Intelligence.pdf"
- Leaving spaces out of filenames will make the Unix folks easier to deal with :)
